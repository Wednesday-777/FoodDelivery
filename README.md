# Description

This project is a full-stack food delivery website built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) and Stripe for payment processing. The platform offers a seamless online food ordering experience 

# Features

Homepage with dynamic menu: Users can browse food items filtered by categories such as desserts and noodles, making it easy to find their favorite dishes.

Responsive design: The website layout adapts smoothly across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices for an optimal user experience.

User authentication: Secure sign-up and sign-in forms enable users to create accounts and manage their orders.

Shopping cart: Add, remove, or adjust item quantities in the cart. Cart details display item images, names, prices, and automatically update the order total.

Checkout process: Users can enter delivery addresses and payment details, with Stripe integration to handle secure payments.

End-to-end user journey: The app guides users from browsing menus to completing their orders with clear navigation and feedback.

# Tech Stack

The tech stack for this food delivery web application is the MERN stack, which combines four main JavaScript-based technologies:

MongoDB: A NoSQL document database used to store application data such as user profiles, food items, orders, and shopping cart contents. It offers flexible schema design and high scalability.

Express.js: A lightweight web application framework for Node.js that provides backend server logic, RESTful API endpoints, routing, and middleware for requests and responses.

React.js: A fast, declarative JavaScript library for building modern, dynamic, and responsive user interfaces. It handles the frontend, presenting food items, the shopping cart, user authentication forms, and order flows.

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment powering the backend server and running Express.js, enabling scalable API development and real-time application features.
